I hired him to help build an important new software module for Foundersuite focused on tracking and monitoring the competitive landscape.  \r\n\r\nHe absolutely rocked the project.  He:\r\n   \r\n* quickly on-boarded and plugged into the code base \r\n* internalized the user stories and revised mockups to better present data \r\n* implemented stretch features to enrich the user experience \r\n\r\nHao worked fast, hit deadlines, and took initiative.  In short, he went miles above and beyond the scope of the project, and really put his soul into it. I would hire him again (and recommend him to others) without reservation. \r\n\r\nNathan Beckord",
