I'm a PC guy but the last few years I've been developing from a Mac because of the native bash shell command line, and everyone around was using Macs. So I'm Mac, PC, Linux, and command line capable, if such is important. I use a text editor mostly, and sometimes Aptana to write code in. I have used Eclipse, but not a big fan, yet. Might check out NetBeans one of these days. Familiar with MVC concepts and have developed under symfony and Zend, briefly. I use Chrome to browse currently, but still use Firefox and Firebug for development and debugging, console.log for JavaScript etc. Checking out git but use svn. I write SQL from scratch but learning to appreciate the MySQL workbench. Exploring unit test driven code. I want to be part of something big that empowers people through my development.\n\nPrefer to work in San Francisco and looking for the next great project and company to work for fulltime; deal directly with companies; PLEASE no second or third party recruiters.

The annual fund-raising activities was declining every year.\n\nDIAGNOSIS: What was needed by the non-profit organization was an automated source of a mailing list and a automated system to create and update the mailing list and print labels for the annual mailing.\n\nSOLUTION: The idea of this problem-solver was to select the Department of Motor Vehicles list of people with driver\u2019s licenses as the source for the mailing list update. I created an automated mailing list by having the current manual list transcribed into automated format. I designed and implemented an automated system that would take the DMV tape and use it to update the mailing list. The system would also use automatic mailing machines to affix labels to envelopes, stuff and sort the envelopes for mailing by the post office. This was the first organization to have an automated method of updating their mailing list and doing automatic mailing.\n\nRESULT: The first year with the new system was an overwhelming success raising three times the money of the manual system and adding many new contributors to the list. This problem-solver was made Assistant Department Manager of the computer department.\n\nSee the Portrait of a Problem-Solver in the publications section."
