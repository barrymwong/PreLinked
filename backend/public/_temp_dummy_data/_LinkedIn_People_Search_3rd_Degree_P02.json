Well, I could go with the usual \"seasoned this\" and \"accomplished that\", but instead let me cut to the chase: despite various titles that I've had throughout the years, I'm a coder, I spend most of my waking hours writing code, reading code, reading about code. I've done significant work in most of the important languages of our times. \n\nA few years ago I turned my career around going from developing mega-data storage systems to mobile. Most would consider that a crazy move, I pretty much had to start over from square one. But here I am today, successful in mobile, enjoying every minute of it, and continuing to get paid for having fun. \n\nIf you're looking for keywords here are some: Objective-C, the whole iOS eco-system, Unix (since '84), Python, to name the main ones, but recently I am very interested in what I believe is possibly the lingua franca of the future : Javascript (jQuery Mobile, Sencha, Cappucino) and of course, node.js. \n\nI thrive on influencing people (without controlling them), learning from my peers and teaching them what I know in exchange. \n\nI thrive on shipping good quality mobile product in cadence. \n\nI like working with UI/Ux designers and going through as many iterations as it takes to get every single pixel in its place. \n\nI tend to choose simple solutions before over-engineered ones, Return on Investment before technological coolness."
