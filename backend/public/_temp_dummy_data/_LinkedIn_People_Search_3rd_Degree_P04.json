In fact, the best engineering managers are excellent engineers, they can cross into both worlds. It just takes training in the soft-skills, the interpersonal people skills.\n\nI began my career as an aeronautical engineer employed at Rockwell International Corporation working on Skylab, Shuttle, Shuttle Tug, and meteorological satellite programs. I then decided I wanted to be more technical and received an M.S. in geophysics and worked as a programmer and researcher for the United States Geological Survey before returning to the flight performance group of Rockwell International. This time at Rockwell, I met four engineers and together we started a software development and systems engineering company focused on Department of Defense programs. I then decided I wanted more business education and so I received an MBA and progressed from program manager to director, to vice president of engineering, chief operations officer and general manager. I then left to join a printer start-up as product manager and director of corporate training, helping the company grow from half a million to over a quarter of a billion dollars in six years.\n\nThroughout my career, it has been clear that, for whatever reason, I had a knack for training and coaching my direct reports to achieve extraordinary capabilities. I ultimately left the corporate world to start my own company dedicated to coaching and training engineers, scientists and technical professionals in the soft skills, the interpersonal people skills and management skills necessary to make the transition from engineer to leader and from engineering manager to engineering leader, and necessary to secure a long term technical career.\n\nI think the difference that makes the difference in my training, coaching, and facilitation  is that I've done it myself.",
